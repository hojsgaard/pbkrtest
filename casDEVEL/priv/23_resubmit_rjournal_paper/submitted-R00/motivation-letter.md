Dear Catherine Hurley,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Computer Algebra in `R` Bridges a Gap Between Mathematics and Data in the Teaching of Statistics and Data Science" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript is a new submission, following a previously submitted and rejected manuscript entitled "Computer Algebra Systems in R with `caracas`". 

The new submission has two main focus points:

1) The interplay between symbolic mathematics and numerical computations in teaching data science and statistics. 
2) Presenting the `caracas` package as a tool for symbolic mathematics within `R` and as a tool for easy creation of documents with mathematical content.

The `caracas` package is accompanied with extensive documentation in the form of manual pages and a large number of illustrative examples in vignettes, also available at Github (see <https://r-cas.github.io/caracas/>).

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article useful for teaching purposes, dissemination and research.
