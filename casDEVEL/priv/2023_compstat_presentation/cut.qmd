#  What do statisticians do?

  - Think carefully about a statistical model for a given problem. This gives likelihood function
  - Differentiate log-likelihood with respect to unknown parameters. This gives score function
  - Set score equal to zero and solve for unknown parameters. This gives maximum likelihood estimates
  - Differentiate score function with respect to unknown parameters. This gives Hessian matrix
  - Invert negative Hessian matrix. Gives asymptotic variance of parameter estimates.
