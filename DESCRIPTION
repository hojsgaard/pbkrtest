Description: Test in mixed effects models. Attention is on mixed
    effects models as implemented in the 'lme4' package. For linear
    mixed models, this package implements (1) a parametric bootstrap
    test, (2) a Kenward-Roger-type modification of F-tests for linear
    mixed effects models and (3) a Satterthwaite-type modification of
    F-tests for linear mixed effects models. The package also
    implements a parametric bootstrap test for generalized linear
    mixed models.  The facilities of the package are documented in the
    paper by Halekoh and Højsgaard, (2012,
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v059.i09>).  Please see 'citation("pbkrtest")'
    for citation details.
