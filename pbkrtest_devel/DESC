Satterthwaites degree of freedom
Kenward-Rogers degree of freedom


Computes p-values based on (a) Satterthwaites or Kenward-Rogers degree
of freedom methods and (b) parametric bootstrap for mixed effects
models as implemented in the 'lme4' package. Implements parametric
bootstrap test for generalized linear mixed models as implemented in
'lme4' and generalized linear models. The package is documented in the
paper by Halekoh and HÃ¸jsgaard, (2012, <doi:10.18637/jss.v059.i09>).
