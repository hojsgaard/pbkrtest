Reviewer 2:

5.
Intersting point.
But I think "KR test independent of  the structure of the random component"
is formally true, but makes no sense, I do not think that  that gives a reasonable test.
It would allow to test against a simple lm model.

PB test, I think that test is NOT independent of the structure of the larger model because the 
  log-likelihood for the larger actual model is based on the random structure of the 
  larger model.
  

General Linear Hypothesis

We allow that already now, but do not write it in the article (we wanted to keep thiongs simple)

KRmodcomp.mer<-function(largeModel,smallModel,beta0=0, details=0) {





Alrgorithm: Fine that the reviewer thinks your proposal  is good.
