\arguments{
\item{fit1}{The larger (alternative) model.}

\item{fit0}{The smaller (null) model.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations. In fixed bootstrap: total number
of simulations. In sequential bootstrap: maximum number of
simulations allowed.}

\item{sequential}{Logical; if TRUE, use sequential bootstrap
sampling to reach target number of extreme hits.}

\item{h}{Number of extreme hits to target in sequential sampling.}

\item{engine}{Parallelisation engine: "serial", "parallel", or
"future".}

\item{nworkers}{Number of workers for parallel/future engine.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, print progress messages.}

\value{
An object of class \code{PBmodcomp}, with print(),
summary(), and plot() methods.

\description{
Compare two nested models using parametric bootstrap simulation of
the likelihood ratio statistic.  Supports models fitted via lm,
lme4 (lmer/glmer), nlme (lme/gls), etc.
}
\details{
The models should both be fitted by maximum likelihood (not
REML). If REML was used, the function will automatically refit with
REML = FALSE where possible.
}
\note{
\strong{Best Practice:} Always fit your models with the \verb{data=}
argument.  This ensures all covariates used in the model
formula are stored with the model object, enabling reliable
simulation and refitting for bootstrap analysis, including on
parallel workers. Without \verb{data=}, refitting may fail in
parallel contexts and reproducibility is compromised.
