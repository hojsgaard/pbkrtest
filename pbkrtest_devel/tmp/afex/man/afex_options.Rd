\usage{
afex_options(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One of four: (1) nothing, then returns all options as a list; (2)
a name of an option element, then returns its' value; (3) a name-value pair
which sets the corresponding option to the new value (and returns nothing),
(4) a list with option-value pairs which sets all the corresponding
arguments. The example show all possible cases.}
}
\value{
depends on input, see above.
}
\description{
Global afex options are used, for example, by \code{\link{aov_car}} (et al.)
and \code{\link{mixed}}. But can be changed in each functions directly using
an argument (which has precedence over the global options).
}
\details{
The following arguments are currently set:
\itemize{
\item \code{check_contrasts} should contrasts be checked and changed to
  sum-to-zero contrasts? Default is \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{type} type of sums-of-squares to be used for testing effects,
  default is 3 which reports Type 3 tests.
\item \code{method_mixed}: Method used to obtain p-values in
  \code{\link{mixed}}, default is \code{"KR"} (which will change to
  \code{"LRT"} soon). (\code{mixed()} only)
\item \code{es_aov}: Effect size reported for ANOVAs (see
  \code{\link{aov_car}}), default is \code{"ges"} (generalized eta-squared).
\item \code{correction_aov}: Correction used for within-subjects factors with
  more than two levels for ANOVAs  (see \code{\link{aov_car}} or
  \code{\link{nice}}), default is \code{"GG"} (Greenhouse-Geisser correction).
  (ANOVA functions only)
\item \code{emmeans_model}: Which model should be used by \pkg{emmeans} for
  follow-up analysis of ANOVAs (i.e., objects pf class \code{"afex_aov"})?
  Default is \code{"univariate"} which uses the \code{aov} model object (if
  present). The other option is \code{"multivariate"} which uses the \code{lm}
  model object (which is an object of class \code{"mlm"} in case
  repeated-measures factors are present).
\item \code{include_aov}: Should the \code{aov} model be included into ANOVA objects of class \code{"afex_aov"}? Setting this to \code{FALSE} can lead to considerable speed improvements.
\item \code{factorize}: Should between subject factors be factorized (with
  note) before running the analysis? Default is \code{TRUE}. (ANOVA functions
  only)
\item \code{sig_symbols}: Default significant symbols used for ANOVA and
  \code{mixed} printing. Default is\code{c(" +", " *", " **", " ***")}.
\item \code{lmer_function}: Which \code{lmer} function should \code{mixed} or
  \code{lmer_alt} use. The default is \code{"lmerTest"} which uses
  \code{\link[lmerTest]{lmer}}, \code{"lme4"} is also possible which uses
  \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}}. Note that \code{mixed} methods \code{"KR"} and
  \code{"S"} only work with \code{"lmerTest"}. For the other methods,
  \code{"lme4"} could be minimally faster, but does not allow to use
  \code{lmerTest::anova()}.
\item \code{return_aov}: Return value of the ANOVA functions (see
  \code{\link{aov_car}}), default is \code{"nice"}.

\note{
All options are saved in the global R \code{\link{options}} with prefix
  \code{afex.}
