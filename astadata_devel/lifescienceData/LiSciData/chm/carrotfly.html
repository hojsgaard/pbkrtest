<h2>Damage of carrots by carrot fly larvae</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Wheatley and Freeman (1982) analysed an experiment on the 
impact of two different insecticides, applied in different soil depths, 
on the damage of carrots by carrot fly larvae.
Additionally to the two insecticides two control experiments without applied insecticides were performed.
The experiment was repeated three times.
</p>
<p>
From each plot on which a treatment had been applied a number 
of carrots were chosen, washed and classified as damaged or not.
