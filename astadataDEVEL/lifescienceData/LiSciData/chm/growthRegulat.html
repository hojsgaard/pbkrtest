<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The effect of two synthetic  growth regulators 
upon the amino acid contents of sugar beets was studied in a 2 <i>times</i> 2
factorial design.
One, maleic hydrazide (regM) has been reported in the literature 
to retard  growth while
the other 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic (regD),  is supposed to be a growth 
promoter at low concentrations.
</p>
<p>
Each regulator was tested against its absence in a field test of 8 
randomized blocks when applied 60 days before harvest.
From each plot the juice of ground beet roots were analyzed for their  
amino-acid content. This was measured by chromatography and the 
optical density at spot 4 was used as the response measurement.
