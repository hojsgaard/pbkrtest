<h2>Effect of apple and orange eating on plaque formation</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
In a trial the effect of eating of apples or oranges on the formation
on dental plaque was analysed. Each child ate an apple after dinner
the one week and the other week an orange.
All children ate the same school meal and the sequence of apple and
orange eaten was randomized.
The extent of plaque was maesured with the Loe index defined as
0: no plaque
1: plaque invisible to the eye, but detactable by probes
2: moderate plaque visible
3: heavy deposits of plaque
