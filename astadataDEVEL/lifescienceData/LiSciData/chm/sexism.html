<h2>Attitude to sexism</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A study was conducted to compare the sexist attitudes of students
at various types of colleges in the US. The colleges-types are:
mixed (gender) college with at least 75% male students, mixed
college with less than 75% male students, and single sex college.
For each gender, random samples of each 10 undergraduate students
were selected from each of the three types of colleges. Each student
filled in a questionnaire, from which a score for `degree of
sexism'-defined as the extent to which a student considered males
and females to have diffeerent life roles-was determined
(the higher the score, the more sexist the attitude).
